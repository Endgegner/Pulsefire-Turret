**Patches "Sniper Turret" to same research when installed
Meant to be comparable and suitable to each other
**Update removed white edges on mip-mapping 
**Update fixes "Sniper Turret" range when installed
Its a minor -not influencing the game or the other mod at all- patch,
just setting the correct range limit, so the debug log gets clean 

Details:
30 DMG Full Metal Jacket bullets
on 56 max. RANGE ingame
and 6 seconds CD
Needs ~9 Researches from scratch Crash Landing
